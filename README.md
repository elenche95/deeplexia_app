## Motivation

Deeplexia is an application developed as a reading, learning and speed reading tool. With ever increasing amounts of reading materials produced in the modern age, speed reading could not be a more valuable skill. It is also a potential tool to help dyslexic people, who experience difficulty reading and have short term memory deficiencies. It is estimated that 65% of people are more visual learners, and since dyslexia is estimated to affect 10% of the world population, the need for a tool to visualise text is clear.
